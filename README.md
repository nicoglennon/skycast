### Installation Notes


* Ruby version
 2.4.2

* Rails version

To install Skycast locally, run `bundle install` in the root directory.

You will also need to add the following variables to an `.env` file:

```
GEOLOCATION_KEY=*your google maps api key*
WEATHER_KEY=*your https://darksky.net/dev/ api key*
```

### Future Goals

- Ability for users to add a location to their favorites
- Breaking up some of the the views into partials - could've been a little more dry
- Mobile design - the app is basically web-only.
